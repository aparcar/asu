# ASU Builder (Go)

A high-performance firmware builder service written in Go with SQLite storage and a modern web interface.

## Features

✨ **Modern Web UI** - Bootstrap 5 interface with real-time dashboards
🚀 **Single Binary** - All-in-one server and worker deployment
💾 **SQLite Storage** - Embedded database with no external dependencies
📊 **Live Statistics** - Chart.js visualizations with auto-refresh
🐳 **Podman Integration** - Official Go bindings for container management
🔄 **Background Workers** - Concurrent job processing
📡 **RESTful API** - Compatible with existing ASU clients

## Architecture

The Go builder is a single binary that runs both the HTTP API server and background build workers. It replaces the Python implementation with:

- **SQLite Database**: Stores build requests, jobs, results, and statistics
- **Podman Integration**: Uses official Podman Go bindings for container management
- **Web Interface**: Bootstrap-based UI with Chart.js visualizations
- **HTTP API**: RESTful API compatible with existing ASU clients
- **Background Workers**: Concurrent job processing with configurable worker count
- **Package Changes Service**: Calls external service for package modifications

## Components

### Database Layer (`internal/db`)
- SQLite with WAL mode for better concurrency
- Build requests, jobs, results, and statistics
- Automatic migrations on startup

### Builder (`internal/builder`)
- Podman bindings for container management
- ImageBuilder container execution
- Package manifest generation
- Firmware image building

### Queue & Workers (`internal/queue`)
- Job queue management using SQLite
- Configurable worker concurrency
- Automatic retries and error handling
- Build statistics tracking

### HTTP API (`internal/api`)
- RESTful endpoints using Gin framework
- Build request submission
- Build status polling
- Statistics and metrics

## Configuration

Configuration can be provided via environment variables (prefixed with `ASU_`) or YAML config file:

```yaml
# Server settings

- Version statistics with cache hit rates
- Diff packages trend analysis
- Detailed statistics tables
- Configurable time ranges (7/30/90 days)

### Configuration (`/config`)
- View all server, database, and build settings
- Container configuration display
- Worker settings overview
- Environment variables reference

## API Endpoints

### Build Endpoints

**POST /api/v1/build**
Submit a new build request.

## Database Schema

See `migrations/001_initial_schema.sql` for the complete schema.

Key tables:
- `build_requests`: Build request details
- `build_jobs`: Job queue and status
- `build_results`: Completed build results
- `build_stats`: Statistical events
- `metadata_cache`: Cached package metadata

## Package Changes Service

The builder calls an external package changes service to apply version-specific package modifications. The service should implement:

**POST /apply**
```json
{
  "version": "23.05.0",
  "target": "ath79/generic",
  "profile": "tplink_archer-c7-v5",
  "packages": ["luci"],
  "default_packages": ["base-files", "busybox", ...],
  "diff_packages": false
}
```

Response:
```json
{
  "packages": ["luci", "additional-package", ...]
}
```

If the service is unavailable, the builder falls back to using the original package list.

## Migration from Python

The Go builder is designed to be a drop-in replacement for the Python implementation:

1. Same API endpoints and request/response formats
2. Compatible with existing clients
3. Stores builds in the same directory structure
4. Can coexist with Python service during migration

### Migration Steps

1. Set up Go builder with same `public_path` as Python service
2. Start Go builder on different port
3. Gradually migrate clients to new endpoint
4. Shut down Python service when migration is complete

## Performance

Benefits over Python implementation:

- **Lower memory usage**: Go's efficient memory management
- **Better concurrency**: Native goroutines vs Python threading
- **Faster startup**: No interpreter overhead
- **SQLite with WAL**: Better concurrent read/write performance
- **Native Podman bindings**: More efficient than subprocess calls
